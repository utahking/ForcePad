Inspired by employees' and developers’ work with customers of all sizes and industries, these apps range from simple utilities to entire vertical solutions. Salesforce Labs applications are free to use, but are not official salesforce.com products, and should be considered community projects - these apps are not officially tested or documented. For support on any Salesforce Labs app please consult the Successforce message boards - salesforce.com support is not available for these applications. Source code for Salesforce Labs applications can be found at https://github.com/ForceDotComLabs. This EULA was last updated on August 24, 2012.
